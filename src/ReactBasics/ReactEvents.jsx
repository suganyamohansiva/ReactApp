export const ReactEvents = () => {

        React Events

        <p>
        Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
<ul>
  <li>
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
</li>
<li>
Adding Events
React events are written in camelCase syntax:
</li>
onClick instead of onclick.
<li>
React event handlers are written inside curly braces:
</li>
<h2>React Event Object</h2>
Event handlers have access to the React event that triggered the function.

In our example the event is the "click" event.
</ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
