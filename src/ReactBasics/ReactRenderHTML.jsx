        <p>React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.
<ul>
  <li>
React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called createRoot() and its method render().
</li>
<h2>The createRoot Function</h2>
The createRoot() function takes one argument, an HTML element.
<li>
The purpose of the function is to define the HTML element where a React component should be displayed.
</li>
<h3>The render Method</h3>
The render() method is then called to define the React component that should be rendered.

But render where?

There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named "public". In this folder, there is an index.html file.
</ul>
</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
