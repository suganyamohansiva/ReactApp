        Create React App doesn't include page routing.
        </li>
React Router is the most popular solution.
<li>
Add React Router
To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application:
</li>
<li>
npm i -D react-router-dom
</li>
<li>
Folder Structure
To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.
</li>
Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:

src\pages\:

Layout.js
Home.js
Blogs.js
Contact.js
NoPage.js
Each file will contain a very basic React component.
</ul>
</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
