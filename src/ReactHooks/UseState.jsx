       <h1>React useState Hook</h1>
        <p>The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

        State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
        <h2>Import useState</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
       
To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component.
</li>
<li>
Notice that we are destructuring useState from react as it is a named export.

Initialize useState
We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component.

<li>
useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
</li>
</ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  };
